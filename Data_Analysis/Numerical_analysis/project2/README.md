# Project 2

### 1. Consider the following liner system equation, where $\delta$ = ${10}^{-n}$, n = 1,2,3,...
     [ δ 3 2 1 ] ( x1 )   ( -3 )
     [ 4 δ 7 5 ] ( x2 ) = ( 2 )
     [ 8 2 δ 2 ] ( x3 )   ( -2 ) 
     [ 0 1 2 δ ] ( x4 )   ( -5 )
(The following is the result of substituting δ=0.1)    
    
#### 1) Find the true solution of x = ${x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}}^{T}$ using matrix inversion
