# Project 1

## 1. Let's approximate sinusoidal functions using Taylor series. We can approximate the following functions near x = 0 as bellows. 
  
$$\mathrm{e}^{x} = \displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{{x}^{n}}{n!}$$
$$\cos (x) = \displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{{-1}^{n}{x}^{2n+1}}{{2n+1}!}$$
