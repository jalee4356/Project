# Analysis of the correlation with the crime rate


## 1. Introduction

   Crime is always happening around us. There are various criminalities in the world, and there may or may not be reasons why crimes occur. Therefore, we tried to visualize and analyze crime-related data from Statis.org through graphs to see which items affect the crime rate. This has been studied using aggregate data on 47 states of the USA for 1960. The data set contains the following items: ‘M: percentage of males aged 14-24 in total state populations’, ‘Ed: mean years of schooling of the population aged 25 years or over’, ‘Po1: per capita expenditure on police protection in 1960’, ‘Po2: per capita expenditure on police protection in 1959’, ‘LF: labour force participation rate of civilian urban males in the age-group 14-24’, ‘M.F: number of males per 100 females’, ‘Pop: state population in 1960 in hundred thousands’, ‘NW: percentage of nonwhite in the population’, ‘U1: unemployment rate of urban males 14-24’, ‘U2: unemployment rate or urban males 35-39’, ‘Wealth: median value of transferable assets or family income’, ‘Ineq: income equality; percentage of families earning below half the median income’, ‘Prob: probability of imprisonment; ratio of number of commitments to number of offenses’, ‘Time: average time in months served by offenders in state prisons before their first release’.
In this report, we checked how much each item affected the crime rate and which one affected the crime rate the most.
