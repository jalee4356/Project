# Box plot

## What is box plot?

Box plot is a type of data visualization that allows you to easily compare different data while simultaneously showing the distribution and outliers of the data. Instead of using the raw data as it is, the data is processed and visualized with a statistical concept called the ‘Five-number Summary’.    

Five-number summary is a method of presenting data with five statistics: the minimum and maximum values, and the first quartile(Q1), the second quartile(Q2, median), and the third quartile(Q3).
